            <h2>Assignment 2 Testing your Understanding</h2>
            <p>Although I can get quite <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anxious"><strong>anxious</strong></a> when speaking
                in
                front of others, I find it so interesting to notice how <strong>nice</strong> other people are. They're
                often so much nice than I allow myself to think. With so many bad things happening in the world, I'm
                always so glad
                to know about the
                <strong>thoughtful acts</strong> people perform everyday. I really appreciate the
                <strong>friends or acquaintances</strong> that ensure
                <strong>everyone in the group is heard</strong>. Even just the simple --
                <strong>"hey I think you got cut off there, you were talking about... etc. etc. ?"</strong> warms my
                heart so much.
